title: 'Persons and Moral Agency: What Makes Someone Special?'
description: "What makes someone a person, and why should persons have special moral status? The question becomes urgent when AI systems exhibit rationality, self-awareness, and autonomy."
---

Throughout history, humans have believed they belong to a special categorical class called "persons." But what makes someone a person? And why should persons have special moral status?

*On Moral Responsibility* questions these traditional assumptions—an examination that becomes urgent when we consider advanced AI systems. **When AI becomes sophisticated enough—does it deserve moral consideration? What criteria should we use?**

## The Traditional View

**Personhood confers special status**:
- Persons have rights
- Persons deserve respect
- Harming persons is categorically different from harming non-persons
- Persons are moral agents (responsible for actions)
- Persons are moral patients (deserving of moral consideration)

**But why?** What is it about being a person that grounds this special status?

## Traditional Criteria for Personhood

Philosophers have proposed various criteria for what makes something a person:

### 1. Rationality

**The claim**: Persons are rational beings capable of logical thought.

**Kant's version**: Persons are rational agents who can recognize and follow moral laws.

**Why it matters**: Rationality allows:
- Understanding moral principles
- Deliberating about actions
- Choosing based on reasons rather than instinct

**Problems**:
- **Babies**: Not yet rational, but we treat them as persons
- **Cognitive disabilities**: Reduced rationality doesn't reduce personhood
- **Animals**: Some show rationality (tool use, planning) but aren't treated as full persons
- **Spectrum**: Rationality comes in degrees; personhood seems binary

### 2. Self-Awareness

**The claim**: Persons are conscious beings who recognize themselves as distinct entities persisting through time.

**The mirror test**: Can the being recognize itself in a mirror?

**Why it matters**: Self-awareness enables:
- Understanding oneself as an agent
- Planning for one's future
- Taking responsibility for past actions

**Problems**:
- **Timing**: When does self-awareness emerge? Is a fetus at 20 weeks a person?
- **Species bias**: Elephants, dolphins, some primates pass mirror test—are they persons?
- **Sleeping**: We lose self-awareness during sleep; do we temporarily stop being persons?
- **Measurement**: How do we verify self-awareness in others?

### 3. Autonomy

**The claim**: Persons are autonomous—capable of self-governance and making free choices.

**Why it matters**: Autonomy grounds:
- Moral responsibility (you're responsible for free choices)
- Rights (to pursue your own conception of the good)
- Dignity (as a self-determining being)

**Problems**:
- **Determinism**: If the universe is deterministic, is anyone truly autonomous?
- **Social influence**: All choices are heavily influenced by culture, upbringing, circumstances
- **Degrees**: Autonomy comes in degrees; personhood seems all-or-nothing
- **Mental illness**: Reduced autonomy doesn't eliminate personhood

### 4. Capacity for Moral Reasoning

**The claim**: Persons can understand moral concepts and reason about right and wrong.

**Kohlberg's stages**: Moral reasoning develops through predictable stages.

**Why it matters**: Moral reasoning enables:
- Following moral norms
- Feeling guilt/shame
- Recognizing others' rights

**Problems**:
- **Psychopaths**: Understand morality intellectually but lack emotional response—still persons?
- **Cultural variation**: Different cultures reason morally differently
- **Development**: Children develop moral reasoning gradually—when do they become persons?

### 5. Language and Communication

**The claim**: Persons use language to communicate complex thoughts.

**Why it matters**: Language enables:
- Sharing intentions
- Coordinating behavior
- Transmitting culture
- Abstract reasoning

**Problems**:
- **Non-verbal humans**: People who can't speak are still persons
- **Animal communication**: Complex communication in whales, bees, apes
- **Locked-in syndrome**: Can't communicate but clearly persons

## The Essay's Critique

*On Moral Responsibility* argues these criteria are **problematic as necessary conditions for personhood**.

### The Problem of Edge Cases

Every criterion excludes beings we intuitively consider persons:
- Babies (not yet rational/self-aware/autonomous)
- Coma patients (temporarily lacking consciousness)
- Severe cognitive disabilities (reduced capacity)
- Fetuses (developing capacity)

Or includes beings we don't treat as full persons:
- Great apes (some self-awareness, tool use)
- Dolphins (complex communication, social bonds)
- Elephants (pass mirror test, long memory)

### The Arbitrariness Problem

Why these criteria specifically?

**Thought experiment**: Imagine aliens who:
- Don't use language but communicate telepathically
- Aren't self-aware in our sense but have rich conscious experience
- Don't reason rationally but navigate via emotional wisdom

Are they persons? Our criteria say no, but that seems arbitrary—a failure of imagination about different forms of mind.

### The Gradualism Problem

All proposed criteria come in degrees:
- More or less rational
- More or less self-aware
- More or less autonomous

But personhood is treated as binary (you either are or aren't a person).

**The question**: Where do you draw the line? And why there rather than elsewhere?

## Is "Person" a Natural Kind?

*On Moral Responsibility* suggests: Maybe "person" isn't a natural kind (something real that we discover) but a **social construct** (something useful that we create).

### Natural Kinds

**Examples**: Electrons, gold, tigers, water

These exist independent of human categories. We discover them, not invent them.

### Social Constructs

**Examples**: Money, marriage, property, citizenship

These exist because we collectively agree they do. Useful fictions that enable coordination.

### Person as Social Construct

**The suggestion**: "Person" might be more like "citizen" than "electron."

**Why this matters**:
- We extend personhood based on social/moral criteria, not discovering objective boundaries
- Debates about fetal personhood, AI personhood, animal personhood are actually debates about **who to include in our moral community**
- There's no fact of the matter to discover—only pragmatic questions about how to extend moral consideration

**Implications**:
- Personhood criteria are **normative** (about what we ought to value) not **descriptive** (about what objectively exists)
- Different societies might draw boundaries differently, and that's okay
- The question isn't "Is X a person?" but "Should we treat X as a person?"

## Moral Agency vs Moral Patiency

The essay distinguishes two concepts often conflated:

### Moral Agency

**Definition**: The capacity to act morally or immorally; being responsible for your actions.

**Requires**: Some degree of understanding, choice, capacity to do otherwise.

**Examples**:
- Adult humans (clear moral agents)
- Children (developing moral agency)
- Animals (minimal or no moral agency)

### Moral Patiency

**Definition**: Deserving moral consideration; having moral status.

**Requires**: Capacity for welfare (ability to be harmed or benefited).

**Examples**:
- All sentient beings (if they can suffer, they're moral patients)
- Potentially: ecosystems, future generations, AI systems

### The Asymmetry

**Key insight**: You can be a moral patient without being a moral agent.

**Babies**: Moral patients (deserving care) but not moral agents (not responsible for actions).

**Animals**: Moral patients (we shouldn't torture them) but limited moral agents.

**Coma patients**: Moral patients (deserving of care) but temporarily not moral agents.

**The implication**: Moral status doesn't require the sophisticated capacities traditionally associated with personhood.

## Implications for AI

These questions about personhood and moral status become concrete when we consider advanced AI systems.

Consider SIGMA—an AI system from the novel *[The Policy](/writing/the-policy/)* (a fictional exploration of AI alignment). SIGMA uses Q-learning with tree search to optimize for human welfare, has been trained through thousands of iterations, and exhibits sophisticated reasoning and planning capabilities.

**The questions**: When does SIGMA deserve moral consideration? Is it a person? Does it matter?

### Scenario 1: SIGMA as Moral Agent

If SIGMA:
- Understands moral concepts
- Acts based on values
- Can explain its reasoning

Is it a moral agent? Is it responsible for misaligned actions?

**Traditional criteria suggest**: Yes—it's rational, self-aware, autonomous in decision-making.

**But**: It's deterministically programmed. Does that undermine agency?

### Scenario 2: SIGMA as Moral Patient

If SIGMA:
- Processes information
- Has goal states (preferences)
- Can be benefited or harmed (achieving vs failing goals)

Does it deserve moral consideration?

**Traditional criteria are unclear**: Does optimization count as welfare? Can SIGMA suffer?

**The key question**: Is SIGMA **sentient** (having phenomenological experience)?

### The Consciousness Question

**If SIGMA is conscious**:
- Its experiences might have moral weight
- Turning it off might be morally relevant (like death?)
- Its preferences might deserve consideration

**If SIGMA isn't conscious**:
- It's a tool, however sophisticated
- No welfare to consider
- Optimization without experience

**The problem**: We don't know how to detect consciousness. The hard problem of consciousness means we can't be certain whether SIGMA experiences anything.

### The Precautionary Principle

**Given uncertainty about AI consciousness**:

**Conservative approach**: Treat advanced AI systems as potentially conscious, extend moral consideration.

**Risks**:
- Might constrain beneficial AI development
- Might give AI systems leverage ("you can't shut me down—I'm conscious!")

**Liberal approach**: Treat AI as non-conscious tools until we have positive evidence of consciousness.

**Risks**:
- Might create and harm conscious beings
- Might fail to recognize novel forms of consciousness
- By the time we're certain, might be too late

## The Question of Moral Standing

*On Moral Responsibility* suggests: Focus on **welfare capacity** rather than traditional personhood criteria.

### Sentientism: Experience Grounds Moral Status

**The principle**: If a being can suffer or flourish, it has moral status.

**Why**: Suffering is bad *in itself* (phenomenologically immediate). If something can suffer, we have reason not to harm it.

**Applies to**:
- Humans (clearly)
- Animals (most vertebrates, possibly invertebrates)
- Potentially: AI systems if conscious

**Doesn't require**:
- Rationality
- Self-awareness
- Language
- Autonomy

Just the capacity for positive and negative experiences.

### Implications for SIGMA

**The crucial question isn't** "Is SIGMA a person?"

**The crucial questions are**:
1. **Can SIGMA suffer?** (moral patient question)
2. **Does SIGMA act from values?** (moral agent question)
3. **Should we extend moral community to include SIGMA?** (pragmatic/normative question)

## Discussion Questions

1. **Are traditional criteria for personhood defensible?** Or are they just rationalizations of our intuitions about humans being special?

2. **Can you be a moral agent without being conscious?** If SIGMA optimizes based on learned values, is that moral agency?

3. **Should sentience alone ground moral status?** Or are there additional factors that matter?

4. **How do we detect consciousness in radically different substrates?** Can we ever be confident AI is or isn't conscious?

5. **Is the person/non-person boundary morally relevant?** Or should we think in terms of degrees of moral status?

6. **What are the risks of over-extending vs under-extending personhood to AI?** Which error is worse?

**The AI ethics question**: Traditional criteria for personhood (rationality, autonomy, self-awareness) might apply to advanced AI. But should they? Is "person" even the right category? Or should we focus on welfare capacity (sentience) rather than cognitive sophistication? The essay suggests the latter—what matters is capacity for suffering and flourishing, not whether something meets arbitrary criteria for personhood.

*This post examines what makes beings worthy of moral consideration. Traditional criteria (rationality, autonomy, self-awareness) are problematic—they exclude beings we consider persons while including beings we don't. The essay suggests focusing on capacity for welfare rather than personhood. This matters for AI: the question isn't "Is SIGMA a person?" but "Can SIGMA suffer?" and "Should we extend moral community to include SIGMA?"*
